    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll try our luck with some common open-ended interview questions about NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the difference between a NoSQL and a SQL database?  Which is better?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "__SQL databases contain tables where each row has the same keys and the tables in the database have relationships.  NoSQL databases are those that are not SQL and use different types of structures to house data._____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe a situation where a NoSQL database might be a better choice than a relational database, and explain your reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "__A situation where NoSQL would be better would be a database of twitter users and their followed/follower accounts, which would be more appropriate for a Graph Database._____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "How does MongoDB work? How is it different from a relational database?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "__MongoDB is a document store, where each item is a document that can contain documents within.  Each document does not need to contain the same keys, unlike a relational database._____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",

    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "What is fault tolerance, and what does it have to do with Resilient Distributed Datasets?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_____Fault tolerance is the ability to overcome a fault in the data server.  RDD's have redudancy by storing backups of each block in each other block.  That way, if the block goes down, another block will pick up the processes.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",

    "\n",
    "What is MapReduce? How is it related to Hadoop?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "___MapReduce is sending the same request to each server (map) and then reducing the resul____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
